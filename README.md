A novel hardware renderer featuring custom shader generation, raymarched SDF implicits, PBR lighting, and NPR palette dithering.

## Screenshots

**Note:**

Due to pixel-perfect dithering, any resolution mismatch (pinch-to-zoom on mobile, mouse wheel zoom on desktop, DPI scale) will result in the loss of intended visual effect.
